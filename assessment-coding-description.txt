Software Developer Coding Assessment

Using a language of your choice, write a small GUI program that takes a URI, breaks it down into its individual components as defined in RFC 3986 and displays those components to the user.

Your entry should include any source files and assets required to build and run the program, and should also include a README.txt with any useful notes on the building or the operation of the program.
